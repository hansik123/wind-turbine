Predicting the energy output of wind turbine based on weather condition. Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the wind conditions present at its site. If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly overproduction.
 
 
       2.  SOLUTION
Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the wind conditions present at its site. If the output can be predicted more accurately using the concept Data science and the technology computer science, in this perspective energy prediction is based on weather condition data present at its site and analyze the important parameters as well as the correlation of energy output.
 	Predicting the energy output of wind turbine based on weather condition is the main idea, but predicting it more accurately is going to help us with energy suppliers to coordinate the collaborative production of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly overproduction. Developing more accurate numerical and statistical wind power forecasting techniques, studying wind power forecasting error. Since, each type of turbine has a different power curve which depends on factors like Area, Geographical position of wind farm, the number and location of turbines within the wind farm also play an important role in the accuracy of forecasting. This study of weather forecasting based on all the factors is going to help us with more accurate and easy way of predicting the energy output.

i. DATA CLEANING AND IMPORTING
Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.
It’s important to understand these different types of data from a statistics point of view. The type of missing data will influence how you deal with filling in the missing values.

SIMPLE EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING

Single Exponential Smoothing, SES for short, also called Simple Exponential Smoothing, is a time series forecasting method for univariate data without a trend or seasonality. It requires a single parameter, called alpha (a), also called the smoothing factor or smoothing coefficient.

Time series is divided into four parts.
● Observed
● Trend
● Seasonal
● Residual



Explanation:
The explains that the Observed is the original time series.
Trend which shows the trend in the time series, i.e., increasing or decreasing behaviour of the time series.
Seasonal, which tells the seasonality in the time series.
Residual, which is obtained by removing any trend or seasonality in the time series.

V. INTRODUCTION TO ARIMA MODEL
ARIMA stands for Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average. It is specified by three ordered parameters (p,d,q).
●  p is the order of the autoregressive model(number of time lags)
● d is the degree of differencing(number of times the data have had past values subtracted)
● q is the order of moving average model.
The ARIMA forecasting for a stationary time series is nothing but a linear (like a linear regression) equation.
There are three basic criterion for a series to be classified as stationary series :
● The mean of the time series should not be a function of time. It should be constant.
● The variance of the time series should not be a function of time.
● The covariance of the ith term and the (i+m)th term should not be a function of time.
Variables can be dependent in various ways, but can only be independent in one way. When they are independent ,more information is gained.So, the time series must be stationary.

vi. PARAMETER TUNING FOR ARIMA MODEL

Stationarity Check
●  Dickey Fuller test to check the stationarity of the series.it determines how strongly a time series is defined by a trend.
● The null hypothesis of the test is that time series is not stationary (has some time-dependent structure).
● The alternate hypothesis (rejecting the null hypothesis) is that the time series is stationary.


Explanation:
The statistics shows us the results of Dickey-Fuller test.

REMOVING TREND
A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. It does not have to be linear.
The increasing trend in the data,we can apply transformation which penalizes higher values more than smaller ones, for example log transformation.
Take rolling average here to remove the trend.Window size of 24 based on the fact that each day has 24 hours.



To make the time series stationary-


Explanation:
The statistics shows us the results of Dickey-Fuller test.
Differencing will help to make the series stable and eliminate the trend.
REMOVING SEASONALITY
Seasonality means periodic fluctuations. A seasonal pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week).
Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period.Seasonal decompose to decompose the time series into trend, seasonality and residuals.



	
Explanation:
The Trends, Residual and Seasonality are clearly observed in the above graph.


	
	
Explanation:
The output tells us that the residuals are stationary.
FORECASTING THE TIME SERIES USING ARIMA
ACF is a measure of the correlation between the TimeSeries with a lagged version of itself.
PACF measures the correlation between the TimeSeries with a lagged version of itself but after eliminating the variations already explained by the intervening comparisons.

	
Explanation:

From the output graph the q value is the lag value where the ACF chart crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time.

Explanation:
From the output graph the p value is the lag value where the PACF chart crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time.
AR MODEL

From the output graph,Red line shows the prediction for validation set and rmse is 113.5370.

MA MODEL

Explanation:
The above model represents the order of the autoregressive model(number of time lags), the degree of differencing(number of times the data have had past values subtracted) and the order of moving average model.
Seasonal order represents the order of the seasonal component of the model for the AR parameters, differences, MA parameters, and periodicity.

From the above output,the rms value is 1186.6039791111011.
